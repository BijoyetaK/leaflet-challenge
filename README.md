# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Assignment
### This assignment is to practice skills of creating geomaps using leaflet and d3.
### Background for analysis: 
  - The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment,   and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Part 1: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
  - Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a category DataFrame that has the following columns:
  - A "category_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "cat1" to "catn", where n is the number of unique categories.
  - A "category" column that contains only the category titles
  - The following image shows this category DataFrame:

  - Export the category DataFrame as category.csv and save it to GitHub repository under Resources folder.

  - Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a subcategory DataFrame that has the following columns:
  - A "subcategory_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "subcat1" to "subcatn", where n is the number of unique subcategories.
  - A "subcategory" column that contains only the subcategory titles.
  - The following image shows this subcategory DataFrame:
  - ![image](https://github.com/BijoyetaK/Crowdfunding_ETL/assets/126313924/6301f284-c113-4703-ae40-e9fa7f6d4b69)
  - Export the subcategory DataFrame as subcategory.csv and save it to GitHub repository under Resources folder.
